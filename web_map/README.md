# Application Name

Web Map

# Application Overview

This application produces an html file that displays a map with three layers: the base layer (the map itself), the circle marker layer (the elevations of some volcanoes in the U.S.A), and the GeoJSON polygon layer (the populations of some countries). The latter two layers can be toggled on/off.

# Application Requirements

1. Python 3
2. Pandas Library
3. Folium Library

# Application Usage

1. Run `python <path-to-python_applications>/web_map/app.py`
2. Open `map.html` in a Web Browser

# Some Application Improvements

1. More comprehensive/up-to-date CSV/JSON data could be used for the circle marker and GeoJSON polygon layers.
2. Additional layers could be added.
