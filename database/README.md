Database

# Application Overview

This application creates a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes storing books in a database convenient and easy. Users may view all books in the database, search for specific books, add books, update books, and delete books. A book entry consists of a Title, Author, Year, and ISBN.

# Application Requirements

1. Python 3
2. Tkinter
3. Sqlite3

# Application Usage

1. Run `python <path-to-python_applications>/database/app.py`
2. Go to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) that Pops Up

# Some Application Improvements

1. Improve the frontend interface by making it look more appealing.
2. Add more features.
3. Prevent duplicate book entries.
4. Install pyinstaller and run `pyinstaller --onefile --windowed <path-to-python_applications>/database/app.py` to create a file that runs the database application by simply opening it, instead of constantly running `python <path-to-python_applications>/database/app.py`.
